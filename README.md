# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java. The game is designed for two players, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Real-time updates: The game updates the board after each move.</p>
<p>Win detection: The game checks for a win or draw after each move and displays the result.</p>
<p>Simple and intuitive UI: Easy-to-understand console interface.</p>
<p>Error handling: Ensures that players can only make valid moves in available positions.</p>
